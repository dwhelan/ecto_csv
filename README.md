# EctoCSV

EctoCSV provides loading and dumping of `csv` files using `ecto` schemas.

This makes it easier to work with `ecto` applications since you can manage `csv` processing similarily to
other data.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `ecto_csv` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ecto_csv, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```


Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_csv](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto_csv).
